# Team3_Benoit_Bhatia_Cheng_Dietrich_Data_Readme

## Project Overview
Our project aims to analyze the impact of e-commerce growth on brick-and-mortar store performance. By integrating various data sources, we will explore correlations, use geospatial analysis, and employ statistical techniques to quantify the impact across different segments. The findings will guide strategic recommendations for retailers and explore potential policy implications.

## Data Sources
1. **Data.gov**: Retail sales data, economic indicators, and consumer spending statistics. [Link](https://www.bea.gov/data/special-topics/distribution-of-personal-income)

2. **IPUMS**: Demographic and socioeconomic data. [Link](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/)
3. **Data.Seattle.gov**: Local retail performance data. [Link](https://data.seattle.gov/City-Business/Active-Business-License-Tax-Certificate/wnbq-64tb/about_data)

## Special Properties
- **Data.gov**: Comprehensive retail sales data, including monthly and annual sales figures, economic indicators, and consumer spending statistics.
- **IPUMS**: Detailed demographic information, including age, gender, income, education, and employment status.
- **Data.Seattle.gov**: Localized retail performance metrics, including foot traffic data, sales figures, and business license information.

## Amount of Data
- **Data.gov**: Approximately 10,000 records covering various retail sectors and time periods.
- **IPUMS**: Demographic data for 1 million individuals, providing a comprehensive overview of the population.
- **Data.Seattle.gov**: Foot traffic data for 100 retail locations, providing insights into local retail performance.

## Wrangling Techniques
- **Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize data formats.
- **Joining**: Merge datasets on common keys such as location, time, and demographic attributes to create a unified dataset.
- **Transformation**: Normalize data, create new calculated fields, and aggregate data as needed for analysis.
- **Analysis**: Perform regression analysis to identify trends and correlations, use geospatial mapping to visualize data, and apply statistical techniques to quantify the impact of e-commerce on brick-and-mortar stores.

## Storage
- Data will be stored in a secure cloud database accessible to all team members. The database will be regularly backed up to ensure data integrity and security. Access controls will be implemented to manage permissions and ensure that only authorized team members can modify the data.
