1. **S \- Defining the Situation**

The growth of e-commerce is significantly impacting the retail industry, creating both challenges and opportunities for traditional brick-and-mortar stores. As more consumers opt for the convenience, variety, and competitive pricing of online shopping, physical stores are seeing declines in sales and foot traffic. This shift raises key questions about the future of traditional retail and how businesses can adapt to these changes. Our project, led by Team 3, seeks to analyze the impact of e-commerce growth on brick-and-mortar store performance by leveraging a variety of data sources, including retail sales data from Data.gov, demographic and socioeconomic data from IPUMS, academic research from EBSCOhost, and local retail performance data from Data.Seattle.gov.

Our collective effort will focus on integrating this data to explore the correlations between e-commerce trends and the performance of physical stores. We will use geospatial analysis to map e-commerce growth against brick-and-mortar sales, and employ statistical techniques to quantify the impact across different segments. Specifically, we aim to identify the key factors influencing consumer preferences between online and physical shopping, understand how demographics and socioeconomic factors affect these choices, and measure the economic impact on retailers. The findings will guide the development of strategic recommendations for retailers to adapt to the changing retail environment, and also explore potential policy implications.

The stakeholders most affected by these trends include:

* Retailers, who need to adjust their strategies to remain competitive in the face of declining in-store sales.  
* Consumers, whose shopping preferences are rapidly evolving due to the convenience of e-commerce.  
* Policymakers, who must consider the economic and social impacts of e-commerce growth, such as job loss in traditional retail and changes in local economies.

To support our analysis, we will draw on existing consumer behavior models and economic theories to better understand the forces driving these trends. By incorporating these theoretical frameworks, we can deepen our insights into consumer motivations and behaviors, while offering a structured approach to interpreting the data.

Ultimately, this project aims to provide evidence-based insights and actionable recommendations that will help retailers, market analysts, and policymakers make informed decisions. Team 3 is committed to delivering a comprehensive analysis that not only examines the measurable impacts of e-commerce growth on brick-and-mortar stores but also considers the broader implications for the retail industry. Through this collective effort, we aim to help stakeholders better navigate the challenges posed by the evolving retail landscape and identify opportunities for growth and adaptation.

2. **T \- Identifying the Target**

The ideal state is clearly identifying and measuring influencing factors of consumer proclivity. Specifically, we will be looking at online versus physical shopping impacts of these factors. The outcome that we are looking for is providing recommendations, insights, and strategies to marketers, sellers, and economic-related policymakers in response to e-commerce growth. By the end of the assignment, the models should be able to determine the answers to the questions decided. We are also expecting to have a geospatial analysis which maps e-commerce growth against brick-and-mortar sales, 

3. **P \- Plan**

The expected outcomes of the project include a comprehensive understanding of how e-commerce growth affects brick-and-mortar retail stores, identification of key factors influencing consumer preferences for online versus physical shopping, and strategic recommendations for retailers to adapt to the rise of e-commerce. This project will provide valuable insights for retailers, market analysts, and policymakers, helping to create more effective retail strategies in response to the growing influence of e-commerce. By analyzing data from various sources and conducting detailed analyses, the project aims to offer actionable insights and recommendations to enhance market performance and address the challenges posed by e-commerce growth.

4. **Possible Major Barriers to Success**

One of the biggest barriers we may face is finding data that is reliable is large and complete enough to cross reference them. Connected to this could be the issue of cleaning data in a manner that provides more accurate results without sacrificing the quality and efficiency of the data. Additionally, in both E-commerce and Brick-and-Mortar there is a rapid evaluation in these fields that could lead to unpredictable trends and results if not examined closely. The final major barrier to success we may face is finding a direct cause-effect relationship as there could be other external factors that impact the trends rather than a direct relationship cause.
